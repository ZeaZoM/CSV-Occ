## Abstract
![Abstract](./figs/Abstract.png)

Recently, predicting 3D semantic occupancy from images has become popular in self-driving 3D scene understanding. Voxel occupancy can describe fine-grained obstacle contours better than 3D object detection's bounding boxes, helping self-driving tasks. Our CSV-Occ method meets two challenges. First, we simplify temporal information fusion by extending the state space model, cutting computational complexity. Second, we help the model accurately vote for voxel-belonging instance centers to fix semantic ambiguity. Tests on Occ3D-nuScenes and nuScenes lidar data show our method excels in camera-based 3D occupancy prediction and lidar semantic segmentation. We think CSV-Occ benefits the self-driving community and industry.
